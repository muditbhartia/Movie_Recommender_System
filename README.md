Movie-Recommendation
=============================
### Introduction 
Movie Recommendation Engine Based on Python which uses the __PCS(Pearson Correlation Similarity) Measure__ to solve for the *closest in likings* users to estimate ratings given to movies by a user which is a __Collabrative Filtering Methodology__.The Engine then uses __K-Means clustering__ to cluster movies of similar genre into groups for boosting the performance and accuracy of predictions. Also made a basic terminal app which asks the user to rate certain movies and the recommends genre based on ratings as well as show to closest users thus predicting age,sex etc. 

### Motivation
The amount of content that is being generated by social media sites, movies, tv shows etc is increasing tremendously and its very hard for a user or person to choose from such a huge pool of content. 
There are endless choices. Hence we need to filter out most of these content and give suggestions to user. 
Recommendation systems are designed to solve this very problem to give users best suggestions based on existing data and the user preferences. 

### Existing System

Recommendation systems are widely used in e-commerce sites such as Netflix to suggest movies , amazon to suggest products, music application such as iTunes and spotify to suggest next songs that the user may like to hear. It can be applied to even domains such as social networking. Facebook uses it for suggesting friends. 


### Proposed System

In this project we implement a collaborative filtering recommendation system that uses existing data to give better suggestions. 
Our Movie Recommendation Engine is Based on Python which uses the PCS(Pearson Correlation Similarity) Measure to solve for the *closest in likings* users to estimate ratings given to movies by a user which is a Collabrative Filtering Methodology.

### Modules

In general recommendation systems are implemented in three ways:
## 1.Collaborative filtering
Collaborative filtering methods are based on collecting and analysing a large amount of information on usersâ€™ behaviours, activities or preferences and predicting what users will like based on their similarity to other users. 
A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analysable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an "understanding" of the item itself

## 2.PCS(Pearson Correlation Similarity)

The similarity is measured using the rating preferences provided by the users. 
In pearson correlation coefficient, the co-rated cases are isolated to make the correlation computation accurate. The pearson correlation coefficient for calculating the similarity between the user u and user v is defined as in 

## 3.K-Means clustering
After finding the similarity using the Pearsons Correlation Similarity measure  
The Engine then uses __K-Means clustering__ to cluster movies of similar genre into groups for boosting the performance and accuracy of predictions.
We have also made a basic terminal app which asks the user to rate certain movies and the recommends genre based on ratings as well as show to closest users thus predicting age,sex etc.

### Dataset and Results
The datatset used for the training and testing of the engine is the __MovieLens100K dataset__ . The schema of the dataset can be read about [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k-README.txt) or in the */data* repo . In brief the dataset has 100,000 user ratings (valued between 1-5) for 943 users across 1682 movies . Along with that essential features of users like age,sex,occupation and zipcode as well as essential features of movies like genre,year etc are provied.</br>
The Engine accuracy will be measured using __Mean squared error__ evaluation between predicted rating and ground truth rating which of around __1.256__.Besides this PCS generated a utility matrix heatmap as well as a user vs ratings heatmap </br>

### File system
The code to replicate the tests on MovieLens dataset is given in Main.py . Run using 

```
$ python Main.py
```

Although all the results are saved in *movielens.ipynb* along with the results and the plots.The data can be found in the */data* repo.Also to run the terminal app:
```
$ python gui.py
```
### Terminal App
The Terminal App uses the concept of closest users to current user based on 10 random movies rated by the (current)user upon which he or she is recommended 5 genre as well as shown closest users.
